# Setup

You need to have Golang installed at the very least `Go 1.11`. The easiest way to set up fupisha in your local environment is to install it using go get:

```Go
 go get github.com/nairobi-gophers/fupisha
```

Run the mongo container which the app will use. Later we will also dockerize the app.

```Go
 docker-compose up
```

# Why build this

It will involve the community and cool techniques like:

- Golang unit testing
- VueJS
- Makefiles
- Circle CI
- Document Databases
- In Memory caching
- Dockerfile, Docker Compose and Docker Image/Container Creation
